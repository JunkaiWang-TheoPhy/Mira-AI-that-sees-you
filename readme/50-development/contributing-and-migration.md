# Contributing And Migration

## Purpose

This page explains how to continue building `Mira_Released_Version` without collapsing it back into a raw prototype dump.

## Choose The Right Area First

Before editing anything, decide which release-side area owns the change.

### Use `core/` when the change is about

- Mira persona
- workspace rules
- release-safe OpenClaw config
- release-safe core plugins
- minimal-core examples

### Use `modules/` when the change is about

- domain-specific capabilities that extend Mira but do not define Mira
- Home Assistant
- future wearable, Apple, printer, or other first-party modules

### Use `services/` when the change is about

- long-running backend processes
- outbound routing
- future helper services that should stay outside core and modules

### Use `deploy/` when the change is about

- operator setup order
- environment templates
- service or module startup instructions

### Use `readme/` when the change is about

- public onboarding
- release navigation
- first-read documentation

### Use `docs/` when the change is about

- migration notes
- architecture addenda
- internal release-side structure decisions

## Recommended Migration Order

When moving material from the prototype repository into the release tree, keep this order:

1. `core`
2. `examples/minimal-core`
3. `services`
4. `modules`
5. advanced composition examples
6. internal release docs

That order preserves the main rule:

- `core` must stand on its own before modules and services expand it

## What To Migrate Carefully

Good migration candidates:

- release-safe templates
- transport-neutral helper code
- typed contracts
- public-facing READMEs
- example configs with placeholders

## What Not To Copy Directly

Do not directly mirror:

- live devbox runtime state
- secrets, API keys, tokens, or auth files
- session logs
- dated working-memory logs
- raw private environment paths unless they are being documented as examples
- live transport glue that still depends on unstable runtime details

## Current Internal Companions

Use these internal release docs together:

- [docs/architecture/README.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/docs/architecture/README.md)
- [docs/migration/README.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/docs/migration/README.md)
- [docs/migration/source-to-release-mapping.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/docs/migration/source-to-release-mapping.md)
- [docs/migration/release-baseline.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/docs/migration/release-baseline.md)
- [docs/migration/open-source-readiness-checklist.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/docs/migration/open-source-readiness-checklist.md)
- [docs/migration/repository-split-readiness.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/docs/migration/repository-split-readiness.md)
- [docs/migration/package-and-license-decisions.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/docs/migration/package-and-license-decisions.md)

## Current Public Entry Companions

Use these public release docs together:

- [readme/00-overview/quick-start.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/readme/00-overview/quick-start.md)
- [readme/00-overview/getting-started.md](/Users/thomasjwang/Documents/GitHub/Javis-Hackathon/Mira_Released_Version/readme/00-overview/getting-started.md)

## Practical Rule

If a proposed addition makes `Mira_Released_Version` look more like a private backup than a public package, it probably belongs in the main prototype repo or in internal docs, not in the release tree itself.

## Shared Verification Entry

The release tree now exposes a shared root-level verification entry:

```bash
cd Mira_Released_Version
npm run verify:release
npm run export:repo
```

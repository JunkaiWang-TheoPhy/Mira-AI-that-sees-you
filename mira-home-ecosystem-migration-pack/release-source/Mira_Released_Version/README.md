# Mira Released Version

Mira is a companion-style agent release built on OpenClaw.

This directory is the staging root for a standalone public repository that will package Mira as:

- a clean core
- official first-party modules
- hardware-facing bridges
- deployable examples
- release-grade documentation

It is not intended to be a raw mirror of the current devbox runtime or a dump of the full prototype workspace.

Current public-repo hygiene companions:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
- [package.json](./package.json)
- [LICENSE.placeholder.md](./LICENSE.placeholder.md)

## Quick Start

The current fastest way into this release tree is:

- [readme/00-overview/quick-start.md](./readme/00-overview/quick-start.md)

The current ordered onboarding path is:

- [readme/00-overview/getting-started.md](./readme/00-overview/getting-started.md)
- [deploy/deploy-paths-overview.md](./deploy/deploy-paths-overview.md)

That page compares the three currently real paths:

- `minimal-core`
- `home-stack`
- `service-notification-router`

## Current Status

`Mira_Released_Version/` is under active assembly.

What already exists in this release tree:

- the first-party `Home Assistant` flagship module scaffold
- a release-oriented device registry example
- the first `sceneResolver` planning skeleton
- module-level architecture specs
- the first release-side `readme/`, `core/`, `services/`, and `deploy/` skeleton
- the first migrated `core/` files for persona, workspace, and config
- the first minimal-core onboarding path
- the first home-stack onboarding path
- a first Git-ready release baseline document
- an open-source readiness checklist

What is not fully migrated yet:

- the remaining non-template `core/` runtime materials outside the current release-safe set
- real deploy recipes
- additional modules such as wearable, Apple, printer, and channel integrations
- most release-side `docs/` and `examples/` contents

So this directory should be read as:

- a release architecture in progress
- not yet a full drop-in standalone repo

## What Mira Is

Mira is designed as:

- OpenClaw-native
- channel-agnostic
- policy-driven
- companion-oriented
- memory-aware

That means:

- OpenClaw provides runtime, sessions, skills, plugins, and channel surfaces
- Mira provides persona, memory behavior, interaction policy, and proactive logic
- modules extend Mira into concrete domains such as household control

## What This Release Is Not

This release should not become:

- a single-vendor bot
- a raw Home Assistant wrapper
- a direct hardware protocol stack
- a devbox backup in public form

The release goal is a clean public structure, not a private-runtime snapshot.

## Release Model

The target release shape is:

```text
Mira_Released_Version/
├─ README.md

The first release-safe core plugin package now also exists:

- [core/plugins/lingzhu-bridge/README.md](./core/plugins/lingzhu-bridge/README.md)

The minimal-core path now explicitly includes both the release-safe config and the release-safe core plugin path:

- [core/openclaw-config/openclaw.example.json](./core/openclaw-config/openclaw.example.json)
- [examples/minimal-core/README.md](./examples/minimal-core/README.md)

The first core-plus-service composition path now exists through:

- [examples/service-notification-router/README.md](./examples/service-notification-router/README.md)
- [deploy/service-notification-router/README.md](./deploy/service-notification-router/README.md)

### Modules

Official optional capability layers such as:

- Home Assistant
- wearable integrations
- Apple-facing integrations
- local device bridges

The module shell now includes:

- [modules/README.md](./modules/README.md)
- [modules/home-assistant/README.md](./modules/home-assistant/README.md)
- [modules/home-assistant/config/README.md](./modules/home-assistant/config/README.md)

### Hardware

Concrete device-side adapters, sidecars, and setup notes.

### Apps

The future release-side application area now has an explicit entrypoint:

- [apps/README.md](./apps/README.md)

### Services

Longer-running backend components such as:

- notification routing
- auth gateways
- future memory or sync helpers

The first reserved release-side service entry is:

- [services/notification-router/README.md](./services/notification-router/README.md)

The first release-safe notification-router package files now include:

- [services/notification-router/config/outbound-policy.example.yaml](./services/notification-router/config/outbound-policy.example.yaml)
- [services/notification-router/config/env.example](./services/notification-router/config/env.example)
- [services/notification-router/src/README.md](./services/notification-router/src/README.md)
- [services/notification-router/src/server.ts](./services/notification-router/src/server.ts)
- [services/notification-router/src/types.ts](./services/notification-router/src/types.ts)
- [services/notification-router/docs/runtime-contract.md](./services/notification-router/docs/runtime-contract.md)

The current deploy stories are now intentionally unified through:

- [deploy/deploy-paths-overview.md](./deploy/deploy-paths-overview.md)

## First Public Module

The first module intentionally being shaped inside this release tree is:

- `modules/home-assistant/`

This is Mira's first-party flagship home-control module.

Its architectural center is:

- typed tools
- scene orchestration
- wearable and presence policy mapping
- ecosystem registry

It exists outside `core/` because Mira's identity is not Home Assistant.
Home Assistant is the current strongest execution surface for the home environment.

The first module onboarding path now exists through:

- [examples/home-stack/README.md](./examples/home-stack/README.md)
- [deploy/module-home-assistant/README.md](./deploy/module-home-assistant/README.md)
- [modules/home-assistant/config/home-assistant-module.example.json](./modules/home-assistant/config/home-assistant-module.example.json)

The first advanced path that combines the flagship module with the outbound service now exists through:

- [examples/home-stack-with-notification-router/README.md](./examples/home-stack-with-notification-router/README.md)

## Available Now

The following files are already present and usable as release-facing references:

### Home Assistant Module Spec

- [scene-resolver-policy-coordination-spec.md](./modules/home-assistant/docs/scene-resolver-policy-coordination-spec.md)

This defines how the future scene resolver should coordinate with:

- the device registry
- risk policy
- confirmation policy
- outbound policy

### Registry Example

- [devices.example.json](./modules/home-assistant/registry/devices.example.json)

This is the current example registry for release-facing home devices and scene bindings.

### Plugin Skeleton

- [loadDevicesRegistry.ts](./modules/home-assistant/plugin/src/registry/loadDevicesRegistry.ts)
- [sceneDefinitions.ts](./modules/home-assistant/plugin/src/scenes/sceneDefinitions.ts)
- [sceneResolver.ts](./modules/home-assistant/plugin/src/scenes/sceneResolver.ts)

These files establish the first TypeScript skeleton for:

- loading normalized release-side device metadata
- declaring scenes
- resolving a scene into a plan instead of executing side effects directly

### Release Skeleton

The release-side public scaffold now includes:

- [readme/README.md](./readme/README.md)
- [core/README.md](./core/README.md)
- [modules/README.md](./modules/README.md)
- [services/README.md](./services/README.md)
- [deploy/README.md](./deploy/README.md)
- [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md)
- [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md)
- [apps/README.md](./apps/README.md)

The first migrated core content is now present inside `core/`, so this release tree is no longer just a pure directory shell.

### Minimal Core Path

The first core-only onboarding path now exists through:

- [examples/minimal-core/README.md](./examples/minimal-core/README.md)
- [deploy/core/README.md](./deploy/core/README.md)
- [core/openclaw-config/openclaw.example.json](./core/openclaw-config/openclaw.example.json)

## Public Design Principles

The release should follow these rules:

1. `core` must stand on its own.
2. Modules must be explicit, not hidden inside runtime snapshots.
3. Hardware-specific logic should stay outside the Mira identity layer.
4. Memory, policy, and safe action boundaries are first-class architecture concerns.
5. Communication channels should stay OpenClaw-native and channel-agnostic.
6. Public release docs should explain the system clearly without exposing private runtime state.

## Recommended Reading Path

If you are new to this release tree, read in this order:

1. this `README.md`
2. `readme/README.md`
3. `core/README.md`
4. `modules/home-assistant/docs/scene-resolver-policy-coordination-spec.md`
5. `modules/home-assistant/registry/devices.example.json`
6. `modules/home-assistant/plugin/src/scenes/sceneDefinitions.ts`
7. `modules/home-assistant/plugin/src/scenes/sceneResolver.ts`

That gives you:

- release intent
- module boundaries
- data model
- planning skeleton

## Roadmap

Near-term release work is expected to add:

1. `core/` persona and runtime skeleton
2. additional module skeletons
3. `services/notification-router/`
4. release-side deploy examples
5. public `readme/` and `docs/` trees

The current scaffold pass has started turning `modules/`, `apps/`, `examples/`, `deploy/`, and `docs/` into explicit release entrypoints rather than placeholders only.

## Contribution Direction

While this release tree is still being assembled, contributions should favor:

- small, explicit module boundaries
- typed interfaces
- safe defaults
- release-facing docs
- configuration templates instead of private live data

Avoid contributing:

- private credentials
- raw session history
- live memory databases
- environment-specific absolute assumptions

## One-Line Summary

`Mira_Released_Version/` is the future public home of Mira: a clean, modular, OpenClaw-native companion agent release with explicit module, hardware, memory, and policy boundaries.
